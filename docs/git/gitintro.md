!!! tip External material

    [Introduction to git material](https://github.com/tudelft3d/git-course-material) should get your started with git.


## Git, GitHub, or GitLab?

The [TUDelft has its own Git server](https://gitlab.tudelft.nl) (a GitLab server), staff can create repositories, but at the moment students cannot :crying_cat_face:.
Also, the repositories, even if created by staff, are *not* open to the outside world and thus we do not recommend using TUDelft's GitLab.

GitHub is free to use for personal use, even for private repository.
This is the preferred option.
